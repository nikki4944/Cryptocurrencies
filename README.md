# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Project Overview

For this deliverable, I used unsupervised machine learning methods in order to analyze a provided cryptocurrencies dataset. The client had no target question in mind to answer with the data so unsupervised machine learning was the best method for an initial data investigation which clustered the cryptocurrencies on the trading market using PCA and K-means. The clusters were then visualized using hvplot to assist the client with their report to their board.
